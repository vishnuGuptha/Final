# Dynamic
 Q2. Create a dynamic component in Angular which has nested components in the following manner: A. Create a button at the top to add a Component X (like a panel). Every time the button is clicked, the component X is added at the bottom. The Component X has a Tab for which we can edit the name and save. B. Within component X, there is another button with text (+) which allows you to add a component Y dynamically. Every time the + button Is clicked, component Y is added within component X C. Component Y has a text box and a save button. When the text is added and save button is clicked, the data is saved in a JSON format to a file. You can write the backend for the same using node.js. D. At the end of the task, you should be able to see the data in the following format: { X1 { Y1, Y2 }, X2 { Y3, Y4 } } Where X1, X2 are names of panels of X components and Y1, Y2.. is the text saved within the Y component.
